# LeetCode 62 - Unique Paths



There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

```
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= m, n <= 100`

### _**Brute-Force \[TLE]**_

Let's start with brute-force solution. For a path to be unique, at atleast 1 of move must differ at some cell within that path.

* At each cell we can either move down or move right.
* Choosing either of these moves could lead us to an unique path
* So we consider both of these moves.
* If the series of moves leads to a cell outside the grid's boundary, we can return 0 denoting no valid path was found.
* If the series of moves leads us to the target cell `(m-1, n-1)`, we return 1 denoting we found a valid unique path from start to end.

**C++**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n, int i = 0, int j = 0) {
        if(i >= m || j >= n) return 0;                                    // reached out of bounds - invalid
        if(i == m-1 && j == n-1) return 1;                                // reached the destination - valid solution
        return uniquePaths(m, n, i+1, j) + uniquePaths(m, n, i, j+1);     // try both down and right
    }
};
```

**Python**

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n, i=0, j=0):
        if i >= m or j >= n:      return 0
        if i == m-1 and j == n-1: return 1
        return self.uniquePaths(m, n, i+1, j) + self.uniquePaths(m, n, i, j+1)
```

_**Time Complexity :**_ **`O(2m+n)`**, where `m` and `n` are the given input dimensions of the grid\
_**Space Complexity :**_ **`O(m+n)`**, required by implicit recursive stack

***

### _**Dynamic Programming - Memoization**_

The above solution had a lot of redundant calculations. There are many cells which we reach multiple times and calculate the answer for it over and over again. However, the number of unique paths from a given cell `(i,j)` to the end cell is always fixed. So, we dont need to calculate and repeat the same process for a given cell multiple times. We can just store (or memoize) the result calculated for cell `(i, j)` and use that result in the future whenever required.

Thus, here we use a 2d array `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` denote the number of unique paths from cell `(i, j)` to the end cell `(m-1, n-1)`. Once we get an answer for cell `(i, j)`, we store the result in `dp[i][j]` and reuse it instead of recalculating it.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int dp[101][101]{};
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n, int i = 0, int j = 0) {
        if(i >= m || j >= n) return 0;
        if(i == m-1 && j == n-1) return 1;
        if(dp[i][j]) return dp[i][j];
        return dp[i][j] = uniquePaths(m, n, i+1, j) + uniquePaths(m, n, i, j+1);
    }
};
```

A more generalized solution should be as follows -

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n));
        return dfs(dp, 0, 0);
    }
    int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& dp, int i, int j) {
        if(i >= size(dp)   || j >= size(dp[0]))   return 0;     // out of bounds - invalid
        if(i == size(dp)-1 && j == size(dp[0])-1) return 1;     // reached end - valid path
        if(dp[i][j]) return dp[i][j];                           // directly return if already calculated
        return dp[i][j] = dfs(dp, i+1, j) + dfs(dp, i, j+1);    // store the result in dp[i][j] and then return
    }
};
```

**Python**

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        @cache
        def dfs(i, j):
            if i >= m or j >= n:      return 0
            if i == m-1 and j == n-1: return 1
            return dfs(i+1, j) + dfs(i, j+1)
        return dfs(0, 0)
```

_**Time Complexity :**_ **`O(m*n)`**, the answer to each of cell is calculated only once and memoized. There are `m*n` cells in total and thus this process takes `O(m*n)` time.\
_**Space Complexity :**_ **`O(m*n)`**, required to maintain `dp`.

### **Dynamic Programming -** Tabulation

We can also convert the above appraoch to an iterative version. Here, we will solve it in bottom-up manner by iteratively calculating the number of unique paths to reach cell `(i, j)` starting from `(0, 0)` where `0 <= i <= m-1` and `0 <= j <= n-1`. We will again use dynamic programming here using a `dp` matrix where `dp[i][j]` will denote the number of unique paths from cell `(0, 0)` the cell `(i, j)`. (Note this differs from memoization appraoch where `dp[i][j]` denoted number of unique paths from cell `(i, j)` to the cell `(m-1,n-1)`)

In this case, we first establish some base conditions first.

* We start at cell `(0, 0)`, so `dp[0][0] = 1`.
* Since we can only move right or down, there is only one way to reach a cell `(i, 0)` or `(0, j)`. Thus, we also initialize `dp[i][0] = 1` and `dp[0][j]=1`.
* For every other cell `(i, j)` (where `1 <= i <= m-1` and `1 <= j <= n-1`), we can reach here either from the top cell `(i-1, j)` or the left cell `(i, j-1)`. So the result for number of unique paths to arrive at `(i, j)` is the summation of both, i.e, `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]`.

**C++**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 1));
        for(int i = 1; i < m; i++)
            for(int j = 1; j < n; j++)
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1];   // sum of unique paths ending at adjacent top and left cells
        return dp[m-1][n-1];         // return unique paths ending at cell (m-1, n-1)
    }
};
```

**Python**

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        dp = [[1]*n for i in range(m)]
        for i, j in product(range(1, m), range(1, n)):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
        return dp[-1][-1]
```

_**Time Complexity :**_ **`O(m*n)`**, we are computing `dp` values for each of the `m*n` cells from the previous cells value. Thus, the total number of iterations performed is requires a time of `O(m*n)`.\
_**Space Complexity :**_ **`O(m*n)`**, required to maintain the `dp` matrix



### _**Space Optimized Dynamic Programming**_

In the above solution, we can observe that to compute the `dp` matrix, we are only ever using the cells from previous row and the current row. So, we don't really need to maintain the entire `m x n` matrix of `dp`. We can optimize the space usage by only keeping the current and previous rows.

A common way in `dp` problems to optimize space from 2d dp is just to convert the `dp` matrix from `m x n` grid to `2 x n` grid denoting the values for current and previous row. We can just overwrite the previous row and use the current row as the previous row for next iteration. We can simply alternate between these rows using the `& (AND)` operator as can be seen below -

**C++**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(2, vector<int>(n,1));
        for(int i = 1; i < m; i++)
            for(int j = 1; j < n; j++)
                dp[i & 1][j] = dp[(i-1) & 1][j] + dp[i & 1][j-1];   // <- &  used to alternate between rows
        return dp[(m-1) & 1][n-1];
    }
};
```

**Python**

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        dp = [[1]*n for i in range(2)]
        for i in range(1,m):
            for j in range(1,n):
                dp[i&1][j] = dp[(i-1)&1][j] + dp[i&1][j-1]
        return dp[(m-1)&1][-1]
```

Or still better yet, in this case, you can use a single vector as well. We are only accessing same column from previous row which can be given by `dp[j]` and previous column of current row which can be given by `dp[j-1]`. So the above code can be further simplfied to (Credits - [@zayne-siew](https://leetcode.com/zayne-siew)) -

**C++**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<int> dp(n, 1);
        for(int i = 1; i < m; i++)
            for(int j = 1; j < n; j++)
                dp[j] += dp[j-1];   
        return dp[n-1];
    }
};
```

**Python**

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        dp = [1]*n
        for _, j in product(range(1, m), range(1, n)):
            dp[j] += dp[j-1]
        return dp[-1]
```

_**Time Complexity :**_ **`O(m*n)`**, for computing dp values for each of the `m*n` cells.\
_**Space Complexity :**_ **`O(n)`**, required to maintain `dp`. We are only keeping two rows of length `n` giving space complexity of `O(n)`.\
There's a small change that can allow us to optimize the space complexity down to `O(min(m, n))`.\
_Comment below if you can figure it out :)_

### _**Math**_

This problem can be modelled as a math combinatorics problem.

* We start at `(0, 0)` cell and move to `(m-1, n-1)` cell.
* We need to make **`m-1` down-moves** and **`n-1` right-moves** to reach the destination cell.
* Thus, we need to perform a **total number of `m+n-2` moves**.
* At each cell along the path, we can choose either the right-move or down-move and we need to find the number of unique combinations of these choices (which eventually leads to unique paths).
* This is nothing but calculating the **number of different ways to choose `m-1` down-moves and `n-1` right-moves from a total of `m+n-2` moves**. Mathematically, this can be represented as -

We could cancel out the `(n-1)!` as well in the above evaluation. We will do one of those based on min(m,n) to give best time complexity in the solution below.

**C++**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        long ans = 1;
        for(int i = m+n-2, j = 1; i >= max(m, n); i--, j++) 
            ans = (ans * i) / j;
        return ans;
    }
};
```

**Python**

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        return factorial(m+n-2) // factorial(m-1) // factorial(n-1)
```

_**Time Complexity :**_ **`O(min(m,n))`** for C++, and **`O(m+n)`** for Python. We could do it in `O(min(m,n))` for python as well using technique used in C++.\
_**Space Complexity :**_ **`O(1)`**
